## Jack Branch

I am a musciain turned software develloper, veteran bug fixer, purveyor or stackoverflow/ msdn forums and aspiring c++/c#/java/rails backend engineer. Simply put I love writing programs, give me a problem to solve and a strong cup of tea and you've got an extremely happy potential employee. I am a rigerous employer of [TDD](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) in all my current projects, both individual projets and team projects using the AGILE work environment. Fundamentally I am a highly motivated, dedicated software develloper, with a keen interest in software/ computng and high enthusiasm for further growth and learning oppertunities.

## Skills

### Software/ Programming

While a rather broad category i believe this is my key skill within this cv, over the past three years I have made it my mission to learn and devellop in a wide variety of different languages, starting from a simple Visual-Basic macro within Excell's VBA editor right up to my current Java Psa version. One may only look at my published work to see how my programs have eveolved, as new tools/ techniques brought to my attention, to see clear evidence of my commitment to furthur improve and refine this skill.

### Numerous applications in several languages:

  - GEN App: python (2016) - A simple music generation program, using my [NRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory) algorithm to both compose and play back created music.
  - [Gen App: C# (2016)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/GenApp) - An improvment on the python version, with a more functional Gui and musical notation display.
  - [Serial-Jam: Java (2016)Js/ max7 (2017)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/Music-Gerenaration-Algorithms/tree/master/JS%20Serialism) - A [serisalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism) compositional program, the *.js* version can be run within **Max 7** to dynamically compose and play serialist compositions.
  - [PSA: C++ (2017)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/Music-Gerenaration-Algorithms/tree/master/PSA%20Original) - My first PSA program, was used to compose my fianl year composition portfolio at university.
  - [PSA Express: C++ (2017)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/PSA-Express) - A second version of PSA, using a varient of Diatonic/ Modal music theory and a slimmer user interface.
  - [Jnote 2018 Java( 2018)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/JcBank) - A note taking java swing desktop application using JUnit for testing and a postgres sql database.
  - [JcBank C++ (2018)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/JcBank) - A c++ banking simulation, modelling payments, data storage and [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) data encryption
  - [Encrypted Diary Ruby (2018)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/EncryptedDiary) - A simply console application simluating a secret diary with data encryption instead of locks.
  - [TestJack Node/Js (2018)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/TestJack) - A javascript testing framwork that runs in browser, modeled on [Jasmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_(JavaScript_testing_framework))
  - [JavaKata: Binary search Java (2018)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/JavaKata) - My attempt at creating/ testing different search methods, from a simple front-end search to a logic driven varient of the [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
  - [Web Takeout Ruby/Sinatra (2018)](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/TakeAwayWeb) - A take-out web application written in sintra/ruby, using the MVC model and a postgres database.
  - [Acebook Ruby/Rails (2018)](https://github.com/Team-Visage/vBook) - A team ruby/rails project, creating a facebook clone using the rails framework.

### Achievements

  - Several musical porftolios using the above musical programs - see soundcloud. 
  - A clear improvment from each program to the next
  - Determination to solve complex problems, and ovecome seemingly insurmountable errors.
  - Usage of new and improved techniques across each program
  - Tackling problems head on and on my own intiative
  - Willingness to learn and commitment to improvment
  - Receptivness to feedback, many files/ applications are written poorly yet I still share them in order to find new ways to         improve
  - Successfull usage of the TDD cycle across several different languages/ frameworks, including writing [my own testing framework](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/TestJack)

### High Pressure Situations/ Teamwork

Working well under pressure is a skill that has taken years to devellop, only by entering difficult situations and streaching my physical and emotional capablities to their limits have I been able to add this to my perverbial toolset. Like all skills these are constantly in a state of devellopment, and I believe that by entering suitably challenging and engaging employment I will best be able to continue my personal and developmental growth.

#### Examples

  - Staying calm is essential, as even the slightest lapse in concentration can at times result in potentially life threaterning consequences. 
  - maintaining effeicient coordination: relaying important infomation (snow condition, cravesce locations, cornices etc.), setting pitches/ belays, walking apline style.
  - several years of climbing instruction volunteering in my late teens.
  - staying patient when things go wrong, and making sensible and well informed decisions, such as turning back when weather conditions become problematic.
  - taking on feedback and learning on the job: much of my current knowledge was gained by embarking on trips with expireienced individuals/ guides, where I have been able learn key mountain skills in a safe and secure environment.
