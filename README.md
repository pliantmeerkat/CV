## Jack Branch

I am a musician turned software developer, veteran bug fixer, purveyor of stackoverflow/ msdn forums and aspiring c++/c#/java/rails back-end engineer. Simply put I love writing programs: give me a problem to solve and a strong cup of tea and you've got an extremely happy potential employee. I am a rigorous employer of [TDD](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) in all my current projects, both individual projects and team projects using the AGILE work environment. Fundamentally I am a highly motivated, dedicated software developer, with a keen interest in software/ computing and high enthusiasm for further growth and learning opportunities.

## Skills

### Software/ Programming

Over the past three years I have made it my mission to learn and develop in a wide variety of different languages, starting from a simple Visual-Basic macro within Excell's VBA editor right up to my projects today. I hope that by looking at my published work it is possible to see how my programs have evolved, showing clear evidence of my commitment to further improve and refine this skill.

#### Achievements

  - Several musical portfolios using the above musical programs.
  - A clear improvement from each program to the next.
  - Determination to solve complex problems, and overcome seemingly insurmountable errors.
  - Usage of new and improved techniques across each program.
  - Tackling problems head on and on my own initiative.
  - Willingness to learn and commitment to improvement.
  - Receptiveness to feedback, many files/ applications are written poorly yet I still share them in order to find new ways to improve.
  - Successful usage of the TDD cycle across several different languages/ frameworks, including writing [my own testing framework](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/TestJack).

### High Pressure Situations/ Teamwork

Working well under pressure is a skill that has taken years to develop, only by entering difficult situations and stretching my physical and emotional capabilities to their limits have I been able to add this to my list of skills. Like all skills these are constantly in a state of development, and I believe that by entering suitably challenging and engaging employment I will best be able to continue my personal and developmental growth.

#### Experienced skier and mountaineer: 

  - Staying calm is essential, as even the slightest lapse in concentration can at times result in potentially life threatening consequences. 
  - Maintaining efficient coordination: relaying important information (snow condition, crevasse locations, cornices etc.), setting pitches/ belays, walking alpine style.
  - Several years of climbing instruction volunteering in my late teens.
  - Staying patient when things go wrong, and making sensible and well informed decisions, such as turning back when weather conditions become problematic.
  - Taking on feedback and learning on the job: much of my current knowledge was gained by embarking on trips with experienced individuals/ guides, where I have been able learn key mountain skills in a safe and secure environment.

#### Makers BnB / vBook (2018) (Whilst at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/))

- Invaluable experience in working within a software team environment.
- Usage of Agile software development, ticket based work distribution and user story/ MVP creation.
- Git workflow techniques: branching, merging, pull request etc.
- Managing group conflicts, compromising on major decisions and sticking to tasks effectively.
- Keeping produced code specific, Dry and easy to read/ change/ understand.
- Experience of planning sessions, creating tasks/ tickets and distributing tasks efficiently
- Achieving all this in a safe and feedback intensive environment, allowing mistakes to be made and key lessons learned as a result.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jul-Sept 2018)

- **Curious and passionate about code:** Not only have I completed the Makers curriculum, but I have worked on numerous projects, Jnote, JcBank etc, alongside these.  Many of these have proved extremely challenging, requiring learning of new frameworks or even languages, but the experience of working/ adapting to new technologies is one that I have began to rather enjoy.
- **Fast, independent learner:** Simply glancing through the projects listed above and/or those found on [my Github](https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/) clearly shows this. not only has my code become simpler, more Dry and better optimised, but perhaps most importantly readabilty is significantly improved.
- **Great collaborator:** Numerous group projects during my time at makers have me achieve this goal, as not only have i learned through hours of team experience, but being in an environment where mistakes are permitted and even encouraged at times has allowed for periods of self reflection, granting opportunity for further growth/ development.
- **OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD**
- **Agile/XP**
- **Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Node**
- **RSpec, Jasmine, Cypress, Capybara, JUnit, GoogleTest**
- **Additional projects, see Jnote, JcBank, JavaKata etc.**

#### University of Surrey (2012-2017)

- Music and sound recording - degree with honors
- achieved despite less than ideal circumstances: several years of personal illness and illnesses in the family
- Whilst unrelated to software lead to my interest in algorithmic composition, culminating in my final project: writing a portfolio of compositions using my software PSA.
- Demonstrates my determined attitude, whereby I was able to return from serious illness and complete my studies.
