## Jack Branch

I am a Musician and composer turned software develloper skilled in several languages (C++, Java, Js, Ruby, Python, C#, see my GitHub for full list), a veteran bug and error fixer (mostly from my own making), purveyor of Stackoverflow and MSDN forums and an aspiring algorithmic composer. I am a lover of problem solving and am not afraid of a challenge, my PSA programs - see my Github - show how despite being a total amateur with no formal training, i was able to create a functional music algorithmic system alongside my full time university studdies and  part-full time job. Is the program perferct? absolutely not but i believe that each attempt i make with my ever increasing programming toolkit will prove coloser to the vision i hold so dear to me.

Semantics aside why should you hire me then? Well I believe that I have a strong capability to learn and improve, and above all programmming is something I find extremely enjoyable. Aside from this I believe that the rest of this CV should demonstrate my other skills/ qualities.

## Skills

#### Software/ Programming

While a rather broad category i believe this is my key skill within this cv, over the past three years I have made it my mission to learn and devellop in a wide variety of different languages, starting from a simple Visual-Basic macro within Excell's VBA editor right up to my current Java Psa version. One may only look at my published work to see how my programs have eveolved, as new tools/ techniques brought to my attention, to see clear evidence of my commitment to furthur improve and refine this skill.

### Numerous applications in several languages:

  - GEN App: python (2016)
  - Gen App: C# (2016) https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/GenApp
  - Serial-Jam: Java (2016), Js/ max7 (2017) https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/Music-Gerenaration-Algorithms/tree/master/JS%20Serialism
  - PSA: C++ (2017) https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/Music-Gerenaration-Algorithms/tree/master/PSA%20Original
  - PSA Express: C++ (2017) https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/PSA-Express
  - PSA 2018: Java (2018) https://github.com/pliantmeerkat/PSA-2018

#### Achievements

  - Several musical porftolios using the above musical programs - see soundcloud. 
  - A clear improvment from each program to the next
  - Determination to solve complex problems, and ovecome seemingly insurmountable errors.
  - Usage of new and improved techniques across each program
  - Tackling problems head on and on my own intiative
  - Willingness to learn and commitment to improvment
  - Receptivness to feedback, many files/ applications are written poorly yet I still share them in order to find new ways to         improve                         

#### High Pressure Situations/ Teamwork

Working well under pressure is a skill that has taken years to devellop, only by entering difficult situations and streaching my physical and emotional capablities to their limits have W been able to add this to my perverbial toolset. Like all skills these are constantly in a state of devellopment, and I believe that by entering suitably challenging and engaging employment I will best be able to continue my personal and developmental growth.

  - several years of climbing instruction volunteering in my late teens.
  - staying patient when things go wrong, and making sensible and well informed decisions, such as turning back when weather conditions become problematic.
  - taking on feedback and learning on the job: much of my current knowledge was gained by embarking on trips with expireienced individuals/ guides, where I have been able learn key mountain skills in a safe and secure environment.
