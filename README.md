## Jack Branch

I am a musciain turned software develloper, veteran bug fixer, purveyor or stackoverflow/ msdn forums and aspiring c++/c#/java backend engineer. Simply put I love writing programs, give me a problem to solve and a strong cup of tea and you've got an extremely happy potential employee.

## Skills

#### Software/ Programming

While a rather broad category i believe this is my key skill within this cv, over the past three years I have made it my mission to learn and devellop in a wide variety of different languages, starting from a simple Visual-Basic macro within Excell's VBA editor right up to my current Java Psa version. One may only look at my published work to see how my programs have eveolved, as new tools/ techniques brought to my attention, to see clear evidence of my commitment to furthur improve and refine this skill.

### Numerous applications in several languages:

#### Achievements

  - Several musical porftolios using the above musical programs - see soundcloud. 
  - A clear improvment from each program to the next
  - Determination to solve complex problems, and ovecome seemingly insurmountable errors.
  - Usage of new and improved techniques across each program
  - Tackling problems head on and on my own intiative
  - Willingness to learn and commitment to improvment
  - Receptivness to feedback, many files/ applications are written poorly yet I still share them in order to find new ways to         improve                         

#### High Pressure Situations/ Teamwork

Working well under pressure is a skill that has taken years to devellop, only by entering difficult situations and streaching my physical and emotional capablities to their limits have W been able to add this to my perverbial toolset. Like all skills these are constantly in a state of devellopment, and I believe that by entering suitably challenging and engaging employment I will best be able to continue my personal and developmental growth.
